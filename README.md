# Orca
Orca is a free open source Android application designed for viewing a schedule for [MIET](https://miet.ru) students.
Also it had a support for [ORIOKS](https://orioks.miet.ru/) system (ORIOKS is a system where a student can view their academic performance), 
but now it has not since the API used by Orca has been dropped.

Orca is not under development and is not maintened.

The application was written about 2 years ago and now I find the code not so good as it could be (look at `MietUtils` class for example. It's awful).
I do not write code like this today, but I decided to keep this project on GitHub with no particular reason.
